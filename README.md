# gf-list

gf-list is a simple vim plugin that extends the gf command to search for
multiple files and uses a quickfix list for selection.

# Default mappings
the default mapping is `gf`. This can be changed for visual and normal mode with
the following variables:
```
g:Gflist_map_n_gf = 'gf'
g:Gflist_map_v_gf = 'gf'
```
